# ImageRecognition
Image Recognition using Machine learning Techniques. A nearly accurate model to recognize images. The code is presently trained with numbers and would be very accurate recognizing them. Once I get a database of faces I would train the system with facial attributes.The project involved training the machine with chunks of data and testing it with new data which emerged successful. Thresholding the image was an important issue throughout the project as simplicity was one of the main concerns. Also since each time generating a database of Image arrays was time consuming, we stored it initially and images were tested on the fly. 
It would all boil down to comparing pixel arrays of the input array to that of the images in the database and create a Counter of the matches.  
The various python dependencies used were :

1) PIL (Pillow) for playing around with images
2) numpy : for generating image arrays and getting cosy with numbers
3) matplotlib.pyplot : For generating graphs
4) Collections
